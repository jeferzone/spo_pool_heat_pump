"""Network-AT for the USR-DR164. UDP 48899; does not touch RS-485.

The module has no AT command for its RS-485 driver-enable pin. After a UART
TX the auto-DE can stay asserted and hold A/B so the outdoor board, the
wired display, and the factory DTU all go quiet. TCP :8899 and WiFi stay
up (``AT+TCPLK=on``). Live Cosma 2026-09-17: three multi-hour holes on the
slave-2 write path; ``AT+Z`` alone (no Modbus) released the bus. The same
weekend on slave 99 (Home Assistant silent) had only 15 s radio flickers.

``+++`` serial AT is unusable here — the bus is never idle long enough.
Do not send Event, heartbeat-to-COM, or FC03 from this module. Event stays
whatever the user set. FC03 also woke the bus, but only because it cycled
DE; it is a write onto a jammed line.
